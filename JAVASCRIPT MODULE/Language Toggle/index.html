        Karen Saxby is the author of the Storyfun series, published by Cambridge
        University Press. She also co-wrote the Fun For series, and is an
        experienced Cambridge English consultant. In this article, she explores
        how stories can be used to make young people's language learning
        meaningful and memorable. As a child, I loved sitting on my
        grandfather's lap while he read me stories. I remember most of them even
        though I am now a grandparent, too! As a child, I was blissfully unaware
        that, as I listened to the stories, I was also learning new words and
        ways in which those new words combined to communicate ideas and life
        lessons. A good story encourages us to turn the next page and read more.
        We want to find out what happens next and what the main characters do
        and what they say to each other. We may feel excited, sad, afraid, angry
        or really happy. This is because the experience of reading or listening
        to a story is much more likely to make us 'feel' that we are part of the
        story, too. Just like in our 'real' lives, we might love or hate
        different characters in the story. Perhaps we recognise ourselves or
        others in some of them. Perhaps we have similar problems. Because of
        this natural empathy with the characters, our brains process the reading
        of stories differently from the way we read factual information. Our
        brains don't always recognise the difference between an imagined
        situation and a real one so the characters become 'alive' to us. What
        they say and do is therefore more meaningful. This is why the words and
        structures that relate a story's events, descriptions and conversations
        are processed in this deeper way.
